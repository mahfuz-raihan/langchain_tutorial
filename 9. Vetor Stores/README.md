# Vector Stores in LangChain
This directory contains implementations and examples of various vector stores that can be used with LangChain. Vector stores are essential for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors, which are commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks.

## Why Vector Stores?
Vector stores allow for efficient similarity search and retrieval of data based on vector representations. They are particularly useful in applications such as:
- Document retrieval
- Recommendation systems
- Image and video search
- Natural language processing
- Machine learning model storage
