I have to say, he's been loving them, and from my perspective, they actually do a fantastic job of cleaning. The bristles are effective, and the integrated toothpaste and pick make them incredibly convenient for on-the-go use, whether it's for work, school, or travel. They truly deliver on the promise of a quick, thorough clean when a traditional brush isn't an option.
My primary reservation, and it's a significant one for me, is the inclusion of fluoride toothpaste. I've been actively trying to move towards products with a "cleaner" paste, and unfortunately, these don't align with that preference. While the product performs exceptionally well in terms of cleaning and convenience, this ingredient choice might lead me to explore other brands in the future that offer a fluoride-free option for similar disposable brushes."""
